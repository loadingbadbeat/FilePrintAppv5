It lists the available printers and allows the user to select a printer by number.

It monitors a specified folder (e.g., "C:\temp\print") for newly created files using a FileSystemWatcher.

When a new file is created in the monitored folder, it attempts to open the file to check if it's available for printing. If the file is still in use (e.g., being written to), it retries several times with a delay before giving up.

If the file becomes available for printing, it sends the file to the selected printer using the PrintDocument class. The file is printed, and upon successful printing, it is deleted from the folder.

If any errors occur during the printing process, it handles the exceptions and provides error messages.

Overall, this script provides a convenient way to automate the printing of files placed in a designated folder, making it useful for tasks like automatically printing documents or reports generated by other applications.
